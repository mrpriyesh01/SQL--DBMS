Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+

SELECT W1.id
FROM Weather W1
JOIN Weather W2
ON W1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(W2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE W1.temperature > W2.temperature;
