Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students.
If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.
The result format is in the following example
Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |

code=
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select case
when id%2=0 then id-1
when id%2=1 and id=(select max(id) from seat)
then id
else id+1
end as id,student
from seat
order by id
+----+---------+
