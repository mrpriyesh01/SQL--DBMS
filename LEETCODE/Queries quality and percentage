We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.

CODE IS HERE=
select query_name , round(avg (rating /position),2) as quality,
round(avg(case when rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end) * 100 ,2) 
as poor_query_percentage
from queries 
where query_name is not null
group by query_name ;
