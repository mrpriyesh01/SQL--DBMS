We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.

CODE IS HERE=
SELECT QUERY_NAME ROUND(AVG(RATING/POSITION),2)AS QUALITY
             ROUND(AVG(IF (RATING<3 THEN 1,0)*100),2)AS POOR_QUERY_PERCENTAGE
                      FROM QUERY
                              WHERE QUERY_NAME IS NOT NULL
                                          GROUP BY QUERY_NAME
