Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:


Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
| 2  | Inner |
| 3  | Leaf  |
| 4  | Leaf  |
| 5  | Leaf  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: 
Node 1 is the root node because its parent node is null and it has child nodes 2 and 3.
Node 2 is an inner node because it has parent node 1 and child node 4 and 5.
Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes because they have parent nodes and they do not have child nodes.
Example 2:


Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.

code=

#using cte
with p_id as (select p_id from tree where p_id is not null group by 1)

select id,
case when p_id is null then 'Root'
when id not in (select p_id from p_id) then 'Leaf'
else 'Inner'
end as type
from tree



#second method
  --using subquery
select id,
Case when id not in(select distinct p_id from tree where p_id not !=null) then 'leaf'
else 'inner'
end as type
from tree;
